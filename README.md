# qee

UPDATE 08/05/24:
I have re-started working on qee, I have a syntax and some ideas nailed down, check back later, stuff should be coming to "dev" soon...

UPDATE 13/04/24: 
qee is current on hold. I have the basic layout, I just need to work on a good syntax and ideas for the actual language itself. 
Please check back later.
Currently I am working on something else...

qee is currently in development. There will be files on the main branch when it is ready to release.
If you cannot wait check out the "dev branch"
